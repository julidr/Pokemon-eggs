## Requirements
Because i made this project with Angular CLI you need to have a Node 6.9.0 or higher and npm 3 or higher. Also keep in mind that i'm using [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)  to get all Pokémon info.

## Setup
Clone or download this repository and run `npm install` to install the necessary modules when you are done follow the Angular CLI instructions: 
### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
